# Recap

- Sampling Distribution: The probability distribution of a given statistic (e.g., mean) taken from a random sample

- Constructing a Sampling Distribution

  - Randomly draw n sample points from a finite population with size N
  
  - Compute statistic of interest

  - List different observed values of the statistic with their corresponding frequencies

# Recap 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="40%",fig.cap="",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

``` 
- As n increases we become more confident (less spread) of our estimate of the  population mean
---
# Recap: CIs

- CIs: Interval or range that encompasses true parameter value

    - Level of confidence
      - 95% is most common
  
Calculation  
  - Lower: estimate - MoE

# Proof by contradiction

> To prove a mathematical statement, A, you assume temporarily that A is false. If that assumption leads to a contradiction, you conclude that A must actually be true

???
A is effect not A is no effect. P value allow us to provide evident against not A
---
# NHST 

- Negate the conclusion: Begin by assuming the opposite – that there is no relationship between X and Y.

- Analyze the consequences of this premise: If there is no relationship between X and Y in the population, what would the sampling distribution of the estimate of the relationship between X and Y look like?

- Look for a contradiction: Compare the relationship between X and Y observed in your sample to this sampling distribution. How (un)likely is this observed relationship?

  - If small, then there is evidence there is a relationship
---
# NHST

- Null Hypothesis $H_0$: There is no significant difference 

    - 0 in population
    - No difference between two or more groups

- Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$: There is a statistically significant difference 

---
# An Example

Toftness, Carpenter, Geller, Lauber, Johnson, and  Armstrong (2017) 

- Does fluency of the instructor lead to better learning of the material? 
---
# Null and Alternative Example

- Does fluency of the instructor lead to better learning of the material? 

  - Null Hypothesis: H0 : $\mu_f$ = $\mu_d$
  
  - Alternative Hypothesis: HA: $\mu_f$ $\not=$ $\mu_d$
---
# Two-sided and One-sided Alternative Hypotheses

- Two-tailed: H0 : $\mu_f$ = $\mu_d$ ; HA = $\mu_f$ $\not=$ $\mu_d$

- One-tailed: H0 = $\mu_f$ = $\mu_d$ ; HA = $\mu_f$ > $\mu_d$

- One-tailed: H0 = $\mu_f$  = $\mu_d$ ; HA = $\mu_f$ < $\mu_d$

- Only use a one-tailed / directional hypothesis if you have a strong theoretical prediction (for example, from a model) or you preregister it

  -  Can gain statistical power
  
  - But sometimes findings are meaningful and interesting if they go in an unexpected  way
  
- We can accommodate both two-tailed and one-tailed tests statistically
---
---
# Two Tailed Test

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="50%",fig.cap="",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics ('images/2tail.png')

```

- The sum of the tails sums to α (0.025 in each tail for a two-tailed when α = 0.05)

- See where the statistic lies relative to a ‘critical score’ that depends on defined alpha (same procedure used to calculate confidence intervals)

- For the right and left tail, if the test statistic  >  1.96  or less than -1.96 (critical value) reject null & accept alternative

---
# One Tailed Test

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="100%",fig.cap="",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics ('images/1-tail.png')

``` 
- 0.05 in each tail

- If statistic within rejection region = reject null & accept alternative

- Do you see why you get power with a one-sided / directional hypothesis?
---
# Should I use a one-tailed or two-tailed test?

- Always use two-tailed when there is no directional expectation

  - There are two competing predictions

- Can use one-tailed when
strong justification for directional prediction

- Never follow up with one-tailed if two-tailed is not statistically significant
---
# Define your level of significance (α)

- Level of significance (α): Probability of rejecting the NULL hypothesis due simply to chance

  - α = 0.05
  
  - Some use others (e.g. 0.01, 0.0000003 particle discovery in high energy physics)
  
 - How do we determine what the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given our data is?

# What is a *p*-value?

# *p*-value

# *p*-value: Schools of Thought

- Ronald Fisher: 

  - Quantifying evidence 
  
     - Smaller *p*-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis 

- Neyman and Pearson: 

    - Null and Alternative hypotheses

    - *p*-value is only used to check if it is smaller than the chosen $\alpha$ level, but it does not matter how much smaller it is

# Steps for Hypothesis Testing

1. State null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

2. Calculate the corresponding test statistic and compare the result against the “critical value”

3. State your conclusion

---
# Steps for Hypothesis Testing

- Step 1 

  - Convert the research question to null and alternative hypotheses

        - The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is a claim of “no difference in the population” 
         - No difference between a population parameter and         hypothesized value: $H_0$ : 𝛍 = 7.56 
         - No difference between one population parameter and another: $H_0$ : $\mu_f$ = $\mu_d$
          - *We usually want to reject this hypothesis*
  
- The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) claims $H_0$ is false: There is some difference

---
# Example

- The problem: In the 1970s, 20–29 year old men in the U.S. had a mean μ body weight of 170 pounds. Standard deviation σ was 40 pounds. We test whether mean body weight in the population now differs.

  - What is null here?
  - What is alternative?

---
# Steps for Hypothesis Testing

- Step 2

  - Calculate the corresponding test statistic and compare the result against the “critical value”

      - *t*, *z*, *F*

         - Is the test statistic  > or < than critical value?

  - A value of the test statistic is interesting if it has only a small chance of occurring when the null hypothesis is true
---
# Steps for Hypothesis Testing

- Step 2 

    - Define your level of significance (α)

- α Interpretation: If we were do this experiment many many times, we would only expect 5% (or another level of significance) to be Type 1 Error
---
# Steps for Hypothesis Testing

- Step 3 

    - State your conclusion

        - Reject the null *p* < $\alpha$
        - Fail to reject the null *p* > $\alpha$

**Never say we found no difference. Instead say you found no statistically significant difference. Can never affirm the null**

# *p*-value Conventions

- Conventions:
  - *p* > 0.10: non-significant evidence against H0

# Correctly reporting and interpreting p-values

-  *p*-values reference the observed data and not a theory

- Report $\alpha$

- Do not use *p*-values as a measure of evidence

---
# *p*-value Misconceptions

.pull-left[

- A non-significant *p*-value does not mean that the null hypothesis is true

  - "There was no difference" 
  - "The null is true"

# *p*-value Misconceptions

  - A significant p-value means that the null hypothesis is false

 - p < .05, therefore there is an effect’, 
 - or ‘there is a difference between the two groups, p < .05’

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="50%",fig.cap="",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

---
# *p*-value Misconceptions

- A significant p-value does not mean that a practically important effect has been discovered 

---
# *p*-value Misconceptions

.pull-left[
-  If you have observed a significant finding, the probability that you have made a Type 1 error (a false positive) is 5%
  - Type 1 error rate references all studies we will perform in the future where the null hypothesis is true
  
  - Not more than 5% of our observed mean differences will fall in the red tail areas.

# 2 Sample Welch’s t-test

- 2 sample tests are interested in whether there are differences between 2 groups

- There are several traditional 2 sample t-tests, where the appropriate version  depending on equal or unequal sample size or variance (giant flow charts!)

- Welch’s t-test gives gives equivalent answer to traditional t-test when there is an  equal sample size or variances, BUT can also handle unequal sample size and  variance.
  - http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2015/01/always-use-welchs-t-test-instead-of.html
- Same t-statistic calculation and t-distribution, just have to apply correction for  degrees of freedom (df)
