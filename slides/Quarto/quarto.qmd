# Hello Quarto!

-   Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown

> ### Quarto^Â®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

## Big Universe

-   RMarkdown for EVERYONE

## What is a Quarto?

![](samplesheet.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

# Formatting

# Header 1

-   Using a single \# gives you a really large header!

## Header 2

-   Using two gives you a slightly smaller header!

### Header 3

...and on

#### Header 4

...and on

##### Header 5

...and on

## Lists

You may also want to use a bulleted list!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   just
-   like
-   this
-   one
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  like

2.  this

3.  one
:::
:::

## Emphasis

-   To emphasize your point you might want to use *italics* or **bold**.

-   To have something appear as code (using a monospace font), surround everything that is code with ticks \`like this\`, so that it shows up `like this`.

## Code Blocks

-   One of the most useful things about markdown documents like this is that you can intersperse your writing with code!

For example, this R code:

```{r}
# reticulate library allows you to run both 
# R and python in the same .qmd
library(reticulate)
#install_miniconda() # to install python

```

```{python}

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

fruits[0]

```

# Callout Blocks

## Callout Blocks

-   Call-out blocks highlight sections of text that interrupt the flow of your regular text. Maybe it's a definition, a warning, or a sidenote

-   When rendering your document to HTML, callout blocks are interactive and can be collapsed and opened.

    ::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
    ## My First Callout Block!

    Say things here
    :::

# Callout Blocks

::: callout-note
## Note

Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

# Callout Blocks

::: callout-warning
## Warning

Callouts provide a simple way to attract attention, for example, to this warning.
:::

::: callout-important
## This is important

Danger, callouts will really improve your writing.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with caption
:::

::: callout-caution
## Caution, under construction

Here is something under construction
:::

## Callout markdown syntax

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
# Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use \`collapse="true"\` to collapse it by default or \`collapse="false"\` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

## Code Chunks

-   `{r, eval=TRUE}` has been replaced with `#| eval = TRUE`

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
print("Don't Run Me")
```

```{r}
#| eval = TRUE
print("Don't Run Me")
```

## Tabsets

Split up and flip between sections of a page, alternative to just two columns

::: panel-tabset
## Element 1

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig.heigh: 4

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)

```

# Building a Website with Quarto

## Software

1.  Github account
2.  Github Desktop

![](build.png){fig-align="center"}

## Preview

1.  You may see a preview of the website in the R Studio browser window, and you can click this little button to preview the blog in your default browser.

![](preview.png){fig-align="center"}

## Writing Your Own Posts

I recommend learning to blog with quarto by opening and modifying the template files.

You can see all of the files in your project by clicking on the files tab:

![](writing_own.png){fig-align="center"}

## New Post

-   To create a new post, copy an existing folder and name it something else

    ![](new_post.png)

## Index

-   Clicking on "index.qmd" should open the file in the R studio text editor (on the left)

-   Give it a new name and delete the default text

    ![](index.png)

## Re-render

![](new_blog.png){fig-align="center"}

# You have made your first blog!

## Share it on Github

1.  Open up Github Desktop

2.  Go to preferences and sign in to your Github.com account

3.  "Add" your blog project folder to Github Desktop

4.  Publish to github.com and uncheck private repository (if you want other people to see it.)

5.  You should now be able to see your new repository in your github.com profile, which means you should be able to see a copy of your blog files in the repository.

## QMD Changes for Github Site

-   To change the output directory from `_site` to `docs` open up `_quarto.yml`, and add the line `output-dir: docs` just like this:

<!-- -->

    project:
      type: website
      output-dir: docs

-   Should see a new docs folder

-   Push your changes to github so that your repository, and activate the github pages option under your repository settings.

## Config File

-   `_quarto.yml`

    -   Metadata

        ``` {project:}
