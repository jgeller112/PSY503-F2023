## What are we going to cover?

-   **Markdown:** a simple text-only format for writing documents
-   **R markdown:** a tool for mixing R code with markdown
-   **Papaja:** Tool for writing APA style articles

# Installing R Markdown

-   First things first

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE

install.packages("rmarkdown")

if(!requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()

```

# Installing R Markdown

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| out.width = "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("open_rmd.png", dpi = 350)
```

## R markdown is a "chimera"

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("img/chimera.jpg", dpi = 350)

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
\### On the input side...

-   Write text in markdown
-   Insert code using R
-   Write "metadata" with YAML
-   Insert equation with LaTeX

## R markdown is a "chimera"

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("img/chimera.jpg", dpi = 350)
```

<br> \### On the output side...

-   Output to HTML
-   Output to PDF
-   Output to Word
-   Many other variations too

## 

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics("img/blogdown.png", dpi = 1000)
```

## Word

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("img/word_document_surface.png", dpi = 300)
```

## Inside

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("img/word_document_inside.png", dpi = 150)
```

## Word documents are complicated

-   A .docx file is a compressed folder with lots of files
-   Your text is buried in with a lot of formatting information

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| out.height = "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/html_document_surface.png")
```

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("img/html_document_inside.png", dpi = 150)
```

## HTML documents are complicated

-   Looks simple because I removed most formatting
-   Still unpleasant to look at

# Introduction

Welcome to my **awesome** class. You will learn all kinds of useful
things about R markdown.

## Why should you care?

-   Markdown is simple and reproducible
-   You can make it pretty if you want to
-   The R Markdown variant lets you add R code

## Notice the theme!

-   My slides are written using markdown (...sort of)
-   So the markdown output you see here matches the slides theme
-   I'll talk about modifying themes later

# What does this have to do with open science?

Using Markdown to generate publications, reports, websites, etc. will:
\* Make dynamically updating them with new results easier \* Reduce
errors from manually entering results \* Create new venues for science
communication

Using Markdown to organize your code will: \* Allow you to organize and
annotate your analyses \* Make it easier for others to tell what you
did, aiding reproducibility

# Hello Quarto!

-   Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown

> ### Quarto^®^ is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

## Big Universe

-   RMarkdown for EVERYONE

![](horst_quarto_schematic.png){fig-align="center"}

## What is a Quarto?

![](samplesheet.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

# Formatting

# Header 1

-   Using a single \# gives you a really large header!

## Header 2

-   Using two gives you a slightly smaller header!

### Header 3

...and on

#### Header 4

...and on

##### Header 5

...and on

## Lists

You may also want to use a bulleted list!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   just
-   like
-   this
-   one
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  like

2.  this

3.  one
:::
:::

## Emphasis

-   To emphasize your point you might want to use *italics* or **bold**.

-   To have something appear as code (using a monospace font), surround
    everything that is code with ticks \`like this\`, so that it shows
    up `like this`.

## Code Blocks

-   One of the most useful things about markdown documents like this is
    that you can intersperse your writing with code!

For example, this R code:

```{r}
# reticulate library allows you to run both 
# R and python in the same .qmd
library(reticulate)
#install_miniconda() # to install python

```

```{python}

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

fruits[0]

```

# Callout Blocks

## Callout Blocks

-   Call-out blocks highlight sections of text that interrupt the flow
    of your regular text. Maybe it's a definition, a warning, or a
    sidenote

-   When rendering your document to HTML, callout blocks are interactive
    and can be collapsed and opened.

    ::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
    ## My First Callout Block!

    Say things here
    :::

# Callout Blocks

::: callout-note
## Note

Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `tip`,
`warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

# Callout Blocks

::: callout-warning
## Warning

Callouts provide a simple way to attract attention, for example, to this
warning.
:::

::: callout-important
## This is important

Danger, callouts will really improve your writing.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with caption
:::

::: callout-caution
## Caution, under construction

Here is something under construction
:::

## Callout markdown syntax

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
# Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by
the user. You can use \`collapse="true"\` to collapse it by default or
\`collapse="false"\` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by
default.
:::

## Code Chunks

-   `{r, eval=TRUE}` has been replaced with `#| eval = TRUE`

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
print("Don't Run Me")
```

```{r}
#| eval = TRUE
print("Don't Run Me")
```

## Tabsets

Split up and flip between sections of a page, alternative to just two
columns

::: panel-tabset

```{r}
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig.heigh: 4

# Visual Editor

-One fairly new feature (and one reason we're using RStudio today!) is
their new [visual markdown
editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/). It's
basically an ultra powerful hybrid of Markdown and Microsoft Word. But
be warned, it's a little buggy if you frequently switch editing modes.

-People write whole books in Markdown, and this may make that seem a
little more achievable. For example, the new visual editor allows [easy
citation management with a Zotero
library](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/)
(if we have time, I'll show you this on my computer).

# Cheat Sheet

-   https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

# The Future

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a sequel to RMarkdown developed by
    RStudio.

-   While they are still maintaining RMarkdown, a lot of new development
    will probably happen in Quarto.

-   The differences between RMarkdown and Quarto are not huge for R
    users ([overview
    here](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)), and there
    is much more RMarkdown documentation available, which is why I
    taught it today.

I encourage you to keep tabs on Quarto's development and try it out,
especially if you're not an R user.
