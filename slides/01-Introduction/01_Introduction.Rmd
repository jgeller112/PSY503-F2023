# My Statistical Goals for You

- Understand the role and philosophy of hypothesis testing

- Rationale and limitations of statistical tests

- Identify the appropriate statistical tests to use

- Perform basic to advanced statistical models in R 

- Build a stronger understanding of probability by using sampling and resampling techniques

- Develop an ability to write and communicate statistical results
---
# Assignments

- 50% Problem Sets (10 x 5) 

- 20% Final Project

- 20% Final Exam 

- 10% Participation
---
# Lectures

- Iâ€™ll highlight main concepts

- My role is to introduce you to the basics of each topic and get you started with
examples

-  It is your responsibility to dig deeper when you need and / or want to

-  Graduate studies â€“ learning to be independent and thinking on your own!
---
# Attendance

- No attendance requirements

- If you are sick please stay home

---
# Class Enviroment

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, SES, etc. ) To help accomplish this:

 - If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Rutgers records, please let me know!
 
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). 

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
