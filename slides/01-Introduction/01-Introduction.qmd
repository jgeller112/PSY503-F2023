# Precept Time

-   PSY 505

    -   Tuesdays 11:00 A.M. - 1:00 P.M.

-   Speaker and workshop focused

-   No HW or papers

# My Statistical Goals for You

-   Understand the role and philosophy of hypothesis testing

-   Rationale and limitations of statistical tests

-   Identify the appropriate statistical tests to use

-   Run statistical models in R

-   Build a stronger understanding of probability by using sampling and
    resampling techniques

-   Develop an ability to write and communicate statistical results

# Grades

-   No points associated with assignments

-   Self-evaluation

    -   Did you meet learning outcomes for the class?

    -   Did you turn in all your assignments?

    -   Based on my feedback, how well did you think you did on
        assignments?

    -   How much time outside of class did spend preparing for class?

    ::: callout-note
    ## Grades

    -   To me a letter grade of A would consist of finishing all the
        labs, engaging with the material at a sufficient level (ie.,
        reading assigned articles, doing independent research outside
        class, asking questions during lecture), and generally being
        present in class. All things considered, I will try (and will
        most likely) honor your grade choice. I mainly want you to
        provide an assessment of how you think you did this semester.
    :::

# Assignments

-   CourseKata Readings

-   Labs

-   Final paper

## Labs

-   Every week (Wednesday) we will have a lab activity covering material
    from that week

-   Lab should be completed in RMD/QMD or Jypter Notebook
    (\*\*reproducible\*\*)

-   Labs will be pushed to Github repository

-   Have until end of the week

# Class Format

## Lectures (Monday)

-   I'll highlight main concepts

-   My role is to introduce you to the basics of each topic and get you
    started with examples

-   It is your responsibility to dig deeper when you need and / or want
    to

-   Graduate studies -- learning to be independent and thinking on your
    own!

    ## Lab (Wednesday)

-   Wednesday will be reserved for working on activities related to the
    topic

-   Also a time to seek clarification on topics from me or your
    classmates

# Attendance

-   No attendance requirements

-   If you are sick please stay home

# Class Environment

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and
honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality,
religion, ability, SES, etc. ) To help accomplish this:

-   If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those
    that appear in your official Rutgers records, please let me know!

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
    your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
    talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
    also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a
    general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your
    concerns).

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
    diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
    (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me
    about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

Class Questions

-   Any general questions about course content or assignments should be
    posted on the class
    \[GitHub\](https://github.com/jgeller112/psy504-advanced-stats/issues)
    Issues. There is a chance another student has already asked a
    similar question, so please check the other posts before adding a
    new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the
    discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!
