Consider enrolling in PSY505

-   Tuesdays 11:00 A.M. - 1:00 P.M.
    -   Speakers and workshop focused

    -   No HW or papers
-   Free food!!!

## My applied statistical goals for you

-   Read papers and understand what researchers are doing

-   Collaborate on projects

-   Analyze data with R

-   Create reproducible documents

-   **Obtain a skill set that generalizes outside academia**

## Assessments

-   CourseKata readings

-   Labs

-   Final paper

## Grades

-   No points associated with assignments

-   Self-evaluation

    -   Did you meet learning outcomes for the class?

    -   Did you turn in all your assignments?

    -   Based on my feedback, how well did you think you did on
        assignments?

    -   How much time outside of class did spend preparing for class?

    ::: callout-note
    #### Grades

    -   To me a letter grade of A would consist of finishing all the
        labs, engaging with the material at a sufficient level (ie.,
        reading assigned articles, doing independent research outside
        class, asking questions during lecture), and generally being
        present in class. All things considered, I will try (and will
        most likely) honor your grade choice. I mainly want you to
        provide an assessment of how you think you did this semester.
    :::

## CourseKata readings

-   It is expected you will work your way through each chapter

    -   **No need to do the surveys at the beginning of some of the
        chapters**

## Labs

-   Every week (Wednesday) we will have a lab activity covering material
    from that week

-   Lab should be completed in .qmd and knitted into a HTML file
    (\*\*reproducible\*\*)

-   Labs will be pushed to individualized Github repository

    -   Have until end of the week (Sunday at 11:59 P.M.)

## Final paper

1.  Reproducible statistical analysis

    -   Find open data (OSF is a good place to start) in your field of
        interest

    -   If you have published something or have a dataset, re-run in a
        reproducible manner

2.  Reproducible APA formatted paper using `papaja`

3.  Power analysis

    -   Run simulations for a hypothetical replication attempt

::: callout-important
More information can be found on the syllabus

## Class Format

#### Lectures (Monday)

-   I'll highlight main concepts

-   My role is to introduce you to the basics of each topic and get you
    started with examples

-   It is your responsibility to dig deeper when you need and / or want
    to

    -    Learning to be independent and thinking on your own is part of
        graduate school

#### Lab (Wednesday)

-   Wednesday will be reserved for working on activities related to the
    topic

-   Also a time to seek clarification on topics from me or your
    classmates

## Attendance

-   No attendance requirements

    ::: callout-caution
    -   If you are sick please stay home
    :::

## Class environment

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and
honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality,
religion, ability, SES, etc. ) To help accomplish this:

-   If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those
    that appear in your official Princeton records, please let me know!

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
    your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
    talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
    also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a
    general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your
    concerns).

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
    diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
    (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me
    about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

## Class Questions

Any general questions about course content or assignments should be
posted on the class
\[GitHub\](https://github.com/jgeller112/PSY503-F2023) Issues. There is
a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please
check the other posts before adding a new question. If you know the
answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to
respond!
