## Today

-   Testing interactions/moderation analysis

    -   Categorical x Continuous
    -   Continuous x Continuous

## Interactions

```{r}
#| eval: false

lm(plant_growth ~ sun_exposure + water)

```

![](images/inter.png){fig-align="center"}

## Interactions

-   Two variables can have **joint effects**, or interact with each
    other

![](images/inter1.png){fig-align="center"}

## What is a moderator?

-   A moderator variable Z (i.e., water) is a variable that alters the
    strength of the relationship between X and Y (sunshine -\> growth)

![](images/moderation2.png){fig-align="center" width="709"}

-   To test for moderation we can add the interaction between Z and X to
    our model

$$
\hat{Y}=b_{0}+b_{1}X (sunshine)+ b_2Z (water) + b_3X*Z$$

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| 
lm(plant_growth ~ sun_exposure * water)
```

# Categorical x Continuous Interactions

## Today's dataset

-   Student evaluations for a sample of 463 courses taught by 94
    professors from the University of Texas at Austin

-   Six students rated the professors' physical appearance

```{webr-r}
evals_agegend=read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgeller112/psy503-psych_stats/master/evals.csv")
evals1= evals_agegend %>%
dplyr::select(ID, score, age, gender)

```

## Research question

-   Does Age and Sex (Males, Females) of the instructor influence
    instructor ratings?

    -   DV: Evals
    -   IV:
        -   Age (continuous)
        -   Gender (categorical)
        -   Age\*Gender interaction

::: callout-note
A categorical x continuous regression model is an ANCOVA
:::

## Scatter plot

```{webr-r}
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(evals1, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", color = "Gender") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## How to conduct moderation analysis?

-   Moderation analysis can be conducted by adding one or multiple
    interaction terms in a regression analysis
-   Z is a moderator for the relation between X and Y, we can fit a
    regression model

$$\begin{eqnarray*} 
Y & = & b_{0}+b_{1}*X+b_{2}*Z+b_{3}*X*Z+e \\ & = & \begin{cases} b_{0}+b_{1}*X+e & \mbox{For females}(Z=0)\\ b_{0}+b_{2}+(b_{1}+b_{3})*X+e & \mbox{For males}(Z=1) \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*}$$

-   When Z=0 (females),the effect of X on Y is $b_1+b_3âˆ—0=b_1$

-   When Z=1 (males), the effect of X on Y is $b_1 + b_3*(1)$

## Steps for moderation analysis

A moderation analysis typically consists of the following steps:

1.  Compute the interaction term XZ=X\*Z

2.  Fit a multiple regression model with X, Z, and X\*Z as predictors

3.  Test whether the regression coefficient for XZ (interaction) is
    significant

    3.1 If so, interpret the moderation effect

4.  Display the moderation effect graphically

## Steps for moderation analysis

-   Compute the interaction term XZ=X\*Z

```{webr-r}
#| eval: false
#| 
evals_interact <- evals1 %>%
 mutate(gender_trt=ifelse(gender=="female", 0, 1), inter=age*gender_trt)

```

## Steps for moderation analysis

-   Center continuous variables

    -   Centering solves two problems:

        -   Interpretation

        -   Multicollinearity

```{webr-r}
evals_interact <- evals_interact %>%
  mutate(age_c=datawizard::center(age))
```

## Steps for moderation analysis

-   Fit a multiple regression model with X, Z, and X\*Z as predictors
-   Test whether the regression coefficient for X\*Z is significant

```{webr-r}
lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact) %>%
  tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>%
  knitr::kable() 
```

## Interpretations

$$\hat{Y}= b_0 + b_1 X + b_2 Z + b_3 X*Z$$

where ( $X$ ) is a continuous predictor and ( $Z$ ) is a dummy coded
categorical predictor.

-   $b_0$: the intercept, or the predicted outcome when X = at mean and
    Z=0
-   $b_1$: the slope of $X$, for a one unit change in $X$ the predicted
    change in $Y$ at $Z = 0$
-   $b_2$: The offset/difference in the intercept for a one unit change
    in $Z$ the predicted change in Y at X = 0 (or at it's mean)
-   $b_3$: The interaction of $X$ and $Z$, the offset/difference in
    slope for $Z$ for a one-unit increase in $X$ (or vice versa)

## Interpretations

```{webr-r}
lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact) %>%
   tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>%
  slice(1) %>% 
  knitr::kable() 
```

```{webr-r}



```

## Interpretations

```{webr-r}
lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact) %>%
   tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>%
  slice(2) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{webr-r}


```

## Interpretations

```{webr-r}
lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact) %>%
   tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>%
  slice(3) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{webr-r}

```

## Interpretations

```{webr-r}
lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact) %>%
   tidy(conf.int=TRUE) %>%
  slice(4) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{webr-r}

```

## Deviation coding

```{webr-r}



```

```{webr-r}



```

## Moderation: simple slopes

-   If the interaction is significant, then you usually ignore the other
    individual effects (age and gender)

-   So what do I do if my interaction is significant?

. . .

-   **A simple slopes/spotlight analysis**

## Steps for Moderation Analysis

-   Obtain simple slopes

    -   Conditional analysis looking at the slope between different
        levels of the moderator

        -   Test if slope $\neq$ 0

## Steps for moderation analysis

```{webr-r}
#hello to our friend emmeans 
library(emmeans)
d=lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact)

emtrends(d, ~ gender_trt, var="age_c") %>%
  kable()
emtrends(d, ~ gender_trt, var="age_c") %>%
  test() %>%
  kable()
```

## Steps for moderation analysis

-   A significant slope in one condition and not in another does not
    mean there is an interaction

    -   Just testing if each slope is $\neq$ 0

-   Must test the interaction!

```{webr-r}
d=lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact)

emtrends(d, pairwise ~ gender_trt, var="age_c")
```

## Interactions

-   You should only be following up interactions if significant!

![](images/gelman.png){fig-align="center"}

## Visualize categorical by continuous interactions

```{webr-r}
ggplot(evals1, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", color = "Gender") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

```

## Visualize Categorical by Continuous Interactions

-   Parallel slopes models still allow for different intercepts but
    force all lines to have the same slope

```{webr-r}

ggplot(evals1, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", color = "Gender") +
  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE)
```

## Parallel slopes

-   Model Comparisons

    -   Test model without interaction to model with interaction

```{webr-r}

# no inter
main<-lm(score~age_c + gender_trt, data=evals_interact) 

# inter
inter<- lm(score~age_c*gender_trt, data=evals_interact)

anova(main, inter)
```

## Parallel Slopes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{webr-r}

## Categorical x Continuous Write--up

::: callout-tip
All continuous predictors were mean-centered and deviation coding was
used for categorical predictors. The results of the regression indicated
that the model significantly predicted evaluation scores (R2 =0.05, F(3,
459) = 8.29, p \<.001, adj. R2 = 0.05) accounting for 5% of the
variance. Age was a significant negative predictor of scores, *b* =
-0.01, *SE* = .003, 95% CI \[-0.02, -0.01\], t = -3.89, *p* \< .001,
with increases in age being associated with lower evals. Gender was also
significant, *b* = -0.208, *SE* = .05, 95% CI \[-0.312, -0.105\], t =
-3.95, *p* \< .001, with women (*M* = 4.04) having lower evals than men
(*M* =4.24). Importantly, there was a significant interaction between
age and gender, *b* = -0.01, *SE* = .01, 95% CI \[-0.02, -0.003\], t =
-2.45, *p* \< .001). A simple slopes analysis indicated a significant
slope for women, *b* = -0.02, *SE* = 0.004, 95% CI \[-0.026, -0.009\],
*t* = -3.92, *p* \< .001, but not men, *b* = 0.004, *SE* = 0.003, 95% CI
\[-0.01, 0.002\], *t* = -1.23, *p* = 0.22. While age does not seem to
affect evaluation scores for men, evaluation scores are poorer for older
women.

## Continuous X Continuous Interactions

-   If the Z (moderator variable) was categorical, you would be checking
    if separate groups (levels) have different slopes for the
    non-categorical variable

-   However, we cant do that with continuous x continuous interactions

## Decomposing Continuous X Continuous Interactions: Spotlight Analysis

-   For continuous moderator variables, you "create" low, average, and
    high groups

    -   Low groups are people who are one SD below the mean

    -   Average groups are people are at the mean

    -   High groups are people who are one SD above the mean

## Probing Interactions: Spotlight Analysis

-   Low/below mean created by *SUBTRACTING* 1 SD

-   High/above mean created by *ADDING* 1 SD

-   The rule is that we have to bring them to the middle because we
    centered so that zero is the middle

```{webr-r}
#create the low and high z score variables 
a <- mean(moderation_vio$caunts_c) + sd(moderation_vio$caunts_c)

at <- mean(moderation_vio$caunts_c)

b <- mean(moderation_vio$caunts_c) - sd(moderation_vio$caunts_c)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Spotlight/simple slopes analysis

```{webr-r}
# create a list for values at a, b, and mean and round 

mylist <- list(caunts_c=c(round(b, 1), round(at,1), round(a, 1)))

# run lm again
d=lm(Aggression~vid_games_c*caunts_c,data=moderation_vio)

# get simple slopes at each level at b a
#adjust for multiple tests
emtrends(d,~caunts_c, var="vid_games_c", at=mylist) %>%
  test(adjust="holm")

```

. . .

-   At average levels of callousness, the association between hours
    played and aggression is positive, *b* = .17

<!-- -->

-   At high levels of callousness, the strength of hours of video games
    predicting aggression is the strongest, *b* = 0.43

## Probing interactions

-   Use `interact_plot` from the `interactions`

```{webr-r}
library(interactions)
interact_plot(d, pred = vid_games_c, modx = caunts_c, interval = TRUE, plot.points = TRUE)
```

## Probing Interactions

-   `ggpredict`

```{webr-r}

ggpredict(d, terms=c("vid_games_c", "caunts_c")) %>% plot(add.data=TRUE)

```

## Probing interactions: Johnson-Neyman Plot

```{r}

## Continuous x continuous write-up

::: callout-tip
::: callout-important
All continuous predictors were mean-centered. The results of the
regression indicated that the model significantly predicted violent
behavior scores (R2 = 0.38,F(3, 438) = 88.46, p \< .001, adj.R2 = 0.37)
accounting for 37% of the variance. Hours was a significant positive
predictor of violence, *b* = 0.17, *SE* = .07, 95% CI \[0.04, 0.3\], t =
2.48, *p* \< .014, with increases in hours played being associated with
higher levels of violence. Callous traits was also a positive predictor
of violence, *b* = 0.76, *SE* = .05, 95% CI \[0.51, 0.65\], t = 15.37,
*p* \< .001, with increases in callous traits being associated with
higher levels of violence. Importantly, there was a significant
interaction between hours played and callous traits, *b* = 0.03, *SE* =
.01, 95% CI \[0.01, 0.04\], t = 3.88, *p* \< .001). Following up with a
simple slopes/spotlight analysis showed the effect was significant at
average levels of callous traits, *b* = -0.42, *SE*= 0.09, *t* = 4.64,
*p* \< .0001 and high levels of callous traits, *b* = -0.42, *SE*= 0.09,
*t* = 4.64, *p* \< .0001, but not at low levels of callous traits, *b* =
-0.09, *SE*= 0.10, *t* = -0.911, *p* = 0.36 Thus, hours playing video
games and violent scores is moderated by callous traits. Specifically,
the relationship between hours playing video games and violence scores
is strongest for those with high callous traits.

## Continuous x continuous write-up

-   JN Technique

::: callout-tip
Since the moderator (callous traits) was continuous, we looked for the
turning points for where exactly, in the value of the moderator, the
effect of the independent variable (Hours) turns from non-significance
to significance (for a pre-specified significance level of 0.05). This
is done using the Johnson--Neyman technique. The Johnson--Neyman
technique showed that at the association between hours played and
aggression is positive for values higher than -1.30. Inside the interval
of \[-16.20, -1.30\], there were no clear associations. There is a
detrimental effect between hours played and aggression at high levels of
callous traits.
