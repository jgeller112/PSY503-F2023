## Lab 10: Factorial Designs

In this lab students will explore a factorial research design using a
scenario involving subjects grouped by rejection sensitivity and their
interactions with partners showing varied emotional expressions. The lab
entails importing and inspecting data in R, understanding the factorial
design's structure using linear modeling and ANOVA, conducting
descriptive statistical analysis, and creating APA-style tables of
means. Students will perform a factorial ANOVA using regression and
traditional methods, analyze effect sizes and power, and visually
represent main and interaction effects. They will also examine simple
effects to understand how partner emotion impacts perceived liking
across different levels of rejection sensitivity.
