## Lab 5

Today's lab will focus on interpreting and running linear models with
more than 2 levels. In particular, you will get practice with using and
interpreting different coding schemes in the context of linear modeling
(e.g., dummy, sum, deviation, and planned contrasts). You will also fit
data using the traditional ANOVA approach and get practice using
`emmeans` to conduct pairwise comparisons and correcting *p*-values for
multiple comparisons.
