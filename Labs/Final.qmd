# Final Paper

All final papers must be submitted by the end of final exams week to your github repository. Please refer to the [syllabus](https://psy503-f2023.netlify.app/syllabus#final-project) for specific details about the paper. 

Here is a link to a website that contains example papers and repositories that have used `papaja` to create reproducible manuscripts:[Erin Buchanan Papers](https://www.aggieerin.com/post/current-publications-with-papaja/). 

You can use `papaja` or `Apaquarto` to create your manuscript--your choice.
