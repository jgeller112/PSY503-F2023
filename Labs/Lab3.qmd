In this lab, students will get practice with: 

- Data wrangling and pre-processing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Bootstrapping
- Data visualization with ggplot2

This assignment focuses on real data from a paper examining the role that songs play in soothing infants (Bainbridge & Bertolo et al., 2021). To get started, you should give the paper a read and broadly understand the question the paper is trying to answer and the methods that they used (note that the methods are described in detail at the end of the paper).
