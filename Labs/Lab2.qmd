Lab 2 uses a dataset from the `mice`package. In this lab, you will screen data for missingness, disagnoise mechanisms of missigness (i.e., MAR, MCAR), and apply different methods for dealing with missigness--all in R. Additionally, students will practice data wrangling and visualizing data in `ggplot.`
