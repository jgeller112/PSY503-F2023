# Lab 9: Interactions 1

For this lab, we will examine core concepts from class to examine data
from:

> Przybylski, A. & Weinstein, N. (2017). A Large-Scale Test of the
> Goldilocks Hypothesis. *Psychological Science*, *28*, 204--215.

Here, you will fit, interpret, and visualize results from a categorical
x continuous interaction. In addition, you will do some data wrangling
along the way. Data analysis is never easy :).

This lab is due on December 3, 2023 at 11:59 P.M.
