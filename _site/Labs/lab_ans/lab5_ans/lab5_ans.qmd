## Data

We'll be looking at a dataset comparing different kinds of treatment for depression. In this study, depressed patients (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to one of three groups:

1.	CBT group 
2.	Psychotherapy group 
3.	Control group (received no therapy) 

- After 10 weeks, participants' depression scores were measured. Our dataset will have just 2 variables: `group` (CBT, Psychotherapy or Control) and `depress` (depression scores). 

* **NOTE:** In this example, lower scores = more depressed. (This is a little counter-intuitive.)

* **NOTE:**
`1` = CBT; 
`2` = Psychotherapy;
`3` = Control

- Load libraries

```{webr-r}
# you will need to add more :)
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(emmeans)
library(faux)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
```

- Import the data

```{webr-r}

depression <- read.csv("data/depression.csv")

```

### Structure of the data

> Is the `group` column a factor? Show me how we can test this. 

```{webr-r}

is.factor(depression$group)

```

> Create a new  `group` column to correspond with labels above and make sure it is a factor

```{webr-r}

# Create a new 'group_fct' column with proper labels and make it a factor
depression <- depression %>%
  mutate(group_fct = factor(group,
                            labels = c("CBT", "Psychotherapy", "Control"))) # order matters here!

```

> Check that the new variable you created is now a factor

```{webr-r}

is.factor(depression$group_fct)

```

## Descriptives

> Summarize the dataset for each group. Use `kable` or `gt`  to create a nice table that lists group names, mean, SD, and N. Use ?? or Google the packages. 

```{webr-r}

library(gt)
depression %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(depress),
    SD = sd(depress),
    N = n()
  ) %>%
  gt()


```

## Dummy coding

- Categorical predictors with more than two levels are broken up into several smaller variables. In doing so, we take variables that don't have any inherent numerical value to them, e.g. `group` , which takes the values `1`/`CBT`, `2`/`Psychotherapy` or `3`/`Control`, and ascribe meaningful numbers that allow for us to calculate meaningful statistics.

>  Run a linear model with the group factor you created

```{webr-r}

model_dummies <- lm(depress ~ group_fct, data = depression)

model_dummies %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable()

```

> In the above model output, what does each coef mean?

- $b_0$: The mean of the CBT Group

- $b_1$: The mean difference between the CBT group and Psychotherapy

- $b_2$: The mean difference between CBT and control group

> Are there any significant differences? Please write-up each difference making the appropiate inferences 

> What does the F value mean? What is the $R^2$?  

- Let's imagine that we have the following (more intuitive) research questions:

1. Is CBT effective (relative to no therapy)? 
2. Is psychotherapy effective (relative to no therapy)? 

>  What do we want as our reference group to answer these research questions?

- We need to change our reference level to the control group

- Now let's make the appropriate dummy codes. Recall that we need *k*-1 dummy codes (where *k* is the number of groups). We have 3 groups, so we need 2 dummy codes. 
 
> Create two dummy codes to answer the two questions above. Use `case_when` or `if_else` to create two new columns in the dataset. 

```{webr-r}

depression <- depression %>%
  mutate(CBT_dummy = if_else(group_fct == "CBT", 1, 0),
         Psychotherapy_dummy = if_else(group_fct == "Psychotherapy", 1, 0))


depression %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()


```

> Run the linear model using these new dummy variables as the IV's

```{webr-r}

model_dummies <- lm(depress ~ CBT_dummy + Psychotherapy_dummy, data = depression)

model_dummies %>%
   tidy() %>%
  kable()

```

> In the above model output, what does each coefficient mean?

- $b_0$: The mean of the control group

- $b_1$: The mean difference between the CBT group and control group

- $b_2$: The mean difference between Psychotherapy  and control group

> Are there any significant differences? Please write-up each difference making the appropiate inferences 

> How does the F value and $R^2$ we got from this model compare to our last model with different (underlying) dummy codes? 

## Sum coding

- Let's imagine our research questions are as follows:

1. Is CBT effective compared to the overall sample?
2. Is Psychotherapy effective compared to the overall sample?

> Create a sum coded variable by hand

```{webr-r}
#code 
depression %>%
  mutate(sum_code1=ifelse(group_fct=="CBT", 1,ifelse(group_fct==                                                 "Psychotherapy", -1, 0)), sum_code2=ifelse(group_fct=="Psychotherapy", 1,ifelse(group_fct== "CBT", -1, 0)))

```

> Create a sum coded variable using `contr_code_sum`

```{webr-r}
library(faux)
#code 
depression_sum <- depression %>%
  mutate(sum_code_faux=contr_code_sum(group_fct, omit="Control"))

```

> Run a linear regression with sum coded variable

```{webr-r}
#
model_sum <- lm(depress ~ sum_code_faux,data = depression_sum)

model_sum %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable()

```

> In the above model output, what does each coefficient mean?

- $b_0$: Grand mean 

- $b_1$: The mean difference between the CBT group and grand mean

- $b_2$: The mean difference between Psychotherapy  and grand mean

> Are there any significant differences?  Please write-up each difference making the appropiate inferences


## Deviation coding

- Let's imagine our research question is a bit different: 

1. Is CBT effective compared to the Psychotherapy? 
2. Is CBT effective compared to control? 

> Code this by hand

```{webr-r}

#code 
depression_dev <- depression  %>%
  mutate(dev_code1=ifelse(group_fct=="Psychotherapy", 2/3, -1/3), dev_code2=ifelse(group_fct=="Control", 2/3, -1/3))

depression_dev %>%
  select(dev_code1, dev_code2)%>%
  head() %>%
  kable()

```

> Now use `contr_code_anova`

```{webr-r}
#
#code 
depression_dev <- depression  %>%
  mutate(dev_code_faux=contr_code_anova(group_fct))

```


> Run a linear regression with the deviation coded variable

```{webr-r}
#
model_dev <- lm(depress ~ dev_code_faux,data = depression_dev)

model_dev %>% 
  tidy() %>%
  kable()
```

> In the above model output, what does each coefficient mean?

- $b_0$: Grand mean 

- $b_1$: The mean difference between the CBT group and Psychotherapy group

- $b_2$: The mean difference between CBT  and control group

> Are there any significant differences?  Please write-up each difference making the appropiate inferences

## DIY contrasts

- Let's imagine our research questions are a bit different again:  What if you wanted to know: 

1. Are Psychotherapy and CBT together better than control?

2. Is Psychotherapy better than CBT?

> Run a linear model testing these specific hypotheses

```{webr-r}
#
PTCB <- c(1/3, 1/3, -2/3)

PTCBT <- c(1/2, -1/2,0)

mat <- cbind(PTCB, PTCBT)

contrasts(depression$group_fct) <- mat

lm(depress ~ group_fct, data = depression) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable()
```

> In the above model output, what does each coefficient mean?

- $b_0$: Grand mean 

- $b_1$: The mean difference between the Psychotherapy and CBT vs. control

- $b_2$: The mean difference between CBT  and Psychotherapy group

> Are there any significant differences?  Please write-up each difference making the appropiate inferences

# Traditional ANOVA 

- Run an ANOVA to determine whether there is a relationship between `Group` and `depression`.

```{webr-r}
#

aov_em <- aov(depress ~ group_fct, data = depression)

aov_em %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable()
```

> What does the F-test tell us? How does this F test compare with the F test from the linear models you ran above?

> Use the `emmeans` package to calculate the means for each group

```{webr-r}
#

library(emmeans)
means <- emmeans(aov_em, specs = ~group_fct)


kable(means)


```

> Calculate post-hoc comparisons

```{webr-r}
#
pairwise <- pairs(means, adjust = "bonferroni")


kable(pairwise)

```

> What is the value of the Bonferroni corrected *p*-value for these comparisons?

- `r .05/3`

```{webr-r}
#
adjust_alpha <- .05/3
```

> Adjust your p-values using Bonferroni adjustment in `emmeans`

```{webr-r}

pairwise <- pairs(means, adjust = "bonferroni")

kable(pairwise)
```

> Adjust your p-values using Holm adjustment in `emmeans`

```{webr-r}
#
pairwise_holm <- pairs(means, adjust = "holm")

kable(pairwise_holm)
```


> What difference do you notice about the Bonferroni vs. Holm correction? 

- Bonf is more conservative

## Plot

>  Visualize the data.

- Make sure it is publication ready! 

```{webr-r}

library(ggrain)

ggplot(depression_dev, aes(x = group_fct, y = depress, fill = group_fct)) +
	geom_rain(rain.side="l") + 
  labs(x="Group", y="Depression Scores", title="Group Depression Scores") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size=12) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
