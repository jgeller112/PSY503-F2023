# Missingness in experimental datasets

-   **Problem:** Researchers often fail to gather every piece of information about each participant

  - Pervasive issue in Psychology

    - More than 20% of studies have rates of missingness that exceed 30% (Fishback & Zhou, 2016)
---
# Survey

<br>
<br>
<br>

-  How many in here deal with missing data in your work?

--

- What do you do about it?

---
# Sources of missingness 

- Sensitive questions (e.g., mental health, political orientation, sexual practices)   
  
--

- Study dropouts (e.g., participants get bored or have better to do)

--

- Ability to complete the study (e.g., moved out of town, unexpected events)
---
# Or...

- Computer crashes 

- Non-responders

- Implausible values excluded

- Non-codable data

- Loss of signal (ERP, eye-tracking)

---
class: middle

- **How much of an issue is it when data are missing?**

--

    - It depends on why the data is missing

---
# Big Issue: WHY data is missing

- We will see several techniques for dealing with missing data

  - The degree to which these techniques are appropriate depends on **how the missing data relates to other variables**

---
# Scenario #1

- Sometimes the fact that a data point is NA may be related to what the value would have been, if we'd been able to measure it

> A health psychologist is surveying high school students about their marijuana use

    - Students who've tried marijuana may be more likely to leave this question blank than those who haven't
    
    - Remaining dataset is biased
    
| True State | What We see |
|------------|-------------|
| Yes        | Yes         |
| No         | No          |
| No         | NA          |
| Yes        | NA          |
| No         | No          |
| Yes        | NA          |
  
---
# Scenario #1

- Sometimes the fact that a data point is NA may be related to what the value would have been, if we'd been able to measure it
  - In other words, some values are more likely than others to end up as NAs
  - All that's relevant here is that there is a statistical contingency
    - The actual causal chain might be more complex
      - e.g., marijuana use -> fear of legal repercussions -> omitted response
---
# Hypothetical Scenario #1

- Further examples:

  - Clinical study where we're measuring health outcome
    - People who are very ill might drop out of the study
  - Experiment where you have to press a key within 3 seconds or the trial ends without a response time being recorded
  
  - People with low high school GPA decline to report it

**Non-ignorable missingness**

---
# Scenario #1

- **Non-ignorable missingness** is bad! 

  - Remaining observations are not representative of the full population
  
  - We cant fully account for what the missing data were, or why they are missing
  
  - We simply don't know what the missing RT would have been if people had been allowed more time
  
- Ideal situation would require us to track down the missing data

---
# Ignorable

- In other cases, data might go missing at "random" or reasons unrelated to study

  - Computer crash
  - Inclement weather
  - Experimenter error
  - Random subsampling of people 
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("expterror.png")
```
---
# Ignorable Missingness

- Ignorable missingness isn't nearly as bad!

  - It's disappointing that we lost some data, but what's left is still representative of the population
  
    - Our data is still a random sample of the population-it's just a smaller random sample
    
    - Still valid to make inferences about the population
---
# Hypothetical Scenario 2

- Another case of ignorable missingness is when the fact that the data is NA can be fully explained by other, known variables
  - Examples:
    - People who score high on a pretest are excluded from further participation in an intervention study
    - We're looking at child SES as a predictor of physical growth, but lower SES families are less likely to return for the post-test
    - DV is whether people say a plural vs singular noun; we discard ambiguous words (e.g., "fish"). Rate of ambiguous words differs across conditions

---
# Missing data: Three basic kinds

Rubin defined missing data as following into three broad categories:

-   Missing completely at random (MCAR) (ignorable)
-   Missing at random (MAR) (ignorable)
-   Missing not at random (MNAR) (non-ignorable)

--

These names are awful, nobody likes them, and we're stuck with them. So it goes...
---
# Big Picture

- Most of modern missing data theory comes from the work of statistician Donald B. Rubin (https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/donald-b-rubin).

- Rubin proposed we can divide an entire data set $Y$ into two components: 

- $Y_\text{obs}$, the observed values in the data set 
- $Y_\text{mis}$, the missing values in the data set 

$$Y = Y_\text{obs} + Y_\text{mis}.$$

We can then have $Y_\text{com}$ stand for the *complete data set, the data set we would have collected if there were no missing values*. Thus, in the special case where we have no missing values

$$Y = Y_\text{obs} = Y_\text{com}.$$
---
# Missing Completly At Randon 

> It is a missing data condition in which the likelihood of missingness depends neither on the observed data $Y_{obs}$, nor on the missing data $Y_{mis}$

---

We can formally express MCAR as: 

$$p(R = 0| \psi),$$

where $p(.)$ indicates a probability distribution, $R$ is the missing data index, $\psi$ is the set of parameters defining the missing data mechanism, and the $|$ sign denotes a conditional relationship. Thus, the expression can be read as "the probability of missingness is conditional on the parameters $\psi$." Note that because there is no mention of any other variables in the equation, this means that missingness is not related to the variables in the data set. 
---
# Missing Completly At Random DAG

- **The main thing to notice is there are no arrows going from either $x$ or $y$ to $r$**

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
dag_coords <-
  tibble(name = c("y", "x", "r", "u"),
         x    = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
         y    = c(1, 2, 1, 2))

dagify(y ~ x,
       r ~ u,
       coords = dag_coords) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_point(alpha = 2/3, size = 20) +
  geom_dag_text(size = 10) +

# MCAR by simulation

- Let's simulate some data

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# how many would you like?
n <- 1000

# missing data probability
p_mis <- .2

# simulate
set.seed(1)

d <- 
  tibble(x = rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(y      = rnorm(n = n(), mean = 0 + 0.5 * x, sd = 0.86),
         r_mcar = rbinom(n = n(), size = 1, prob = 1 - p_mis)) %>% 
  mutate(y_mcar = ifelse(r_mcar == 1, y, NA))

```

# Missing At Random (MAR)

> Condition in which the probability that data are missing depends only on the observed $Y_{obs}$, but not on the missing $Y_mis$, after controlling for $Y_{obs} 

---
We can formally express MAR as: 

$$p(R = 0 | \color{darkred}{Y_\text{obs}}, \psi),$$

where $Y_\text{obs}$ is the observed part of the data. Thus, the expression can be read as "the probability of missingness is conditional on the observed data and the parameters $\psi$ which connect $Y_\text{obs}$ with $R$ (e.g., as in a regression model).

---
# MAR DAG

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="80%" }
dag_coords <-
  tibble(name = c("y", "x", "r", "u"),
         x    = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
         y    = c(1, 2, 1, 2))

dagify(y ~ x,
       r ~ u + x,
       coords = dag_coords) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_point(alpha = 2/3, size = 20) +
  geom_dag_text(size = 10) +
  geom_dag_edges(arrow_directed = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "in"), type = "closed")) +
  ggtitle("MAR for y") +
  theme_dag()
```

Notice how now we have an arrow from $x$ to $r$, indicating missingness is some kind of function of $x$. Also recall that though we have missing data on $y$, there are no missing data of $x$.
---
#### MAR by simulation.

The missing data are MAR. This is because the line of code that defined the missing data mechanism (i.e., the line defining `r_mar`) was a function of `x`. This fulfills Rubin's definition of $p(R = 0 | \color{darkred}{Y_\text{obs}}, \psi)$.

```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  # conditional on x
  mutate(r_mar = ifelse(x < -1, NA, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(y_mar = ifelse(r_mar == 1, y, NA))

# what is this?
d
```

---
# MNAR/NMAR

> The probability of missing depends on the missing value itself

---

We can formally express MAR as

$$p(R = 0 | {Y_\text{obs}}, \color{darkred}{Y_\text{mis}}, \psi),$$

where $Y_\text{mis}$ is the missing part of the data. Thus, the expression can be read as "the probability of missingness is conditional on the observed data, the missing data, and the parameters $\psi$ which connect $Y_\text{obs}$ and $Y_\text{mis}$ to $R$.
---
# NMAR DAG.

Here's the DAG for MNAR in $y$:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
dag_coords <-
  tibble(name = c("y", "x", "r", "u"),
         x    = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
         y    = c(1, 2, 1, 2))

dagify(y ~ x,
       r ~ u + x + y,
       coords = dag_coords) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_point(alpha = 2/3, size = 20) +
  geom_dag_text(size = 10) +
  geom_dag_edges(arrow_directed = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "in"), type = "closed")) +
  ggtitle("MNAR for y") +
  theme_dag()
```

Notice how now we have an arrow from $y$ to $r$, indicating missingness in $y$ is some kind of function of the $y$ values we are missing.
---
# MNAR by Simulation

- Let's simulate some more data

```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  # conditional on x and y
  mutate(r_mnar = ifelse(x < -1 | y < -1, NA, 1)) %>%

# Multiple Imputation

- Basically doing conditional imputation several times

1. We make several multiply imputed data sets with the `mice()` function

2. We fit our model of choice to each version of the data with the `with()` function

3. We then pool (i.e., combine) the results with the `pool()` function.

Anyways, what is `imp`?

```{r}
str(imp, max.level = 1)
```

What is `imp` within `imp`?

```{r}
str(imp$imp, max.level = 1)
