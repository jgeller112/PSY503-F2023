## Data
For this lab, we will replicate the mediation results of Cho et al.'s (2023) study titled "Changes in Medial Prefrontal Cortex Mediate Effects of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback on Positive Emotional Memory Biases." On page 7 of the article, the authors provide a path diagram of the mediation model they employed. The data for the mediation analysis can be found at https://osf.io/t5s4z/.



## Task

Your task is to reproduce the study by Cho et al. (2023) by following the steps below:

- Utilize R to apply Baron & Kenny's causal steps approach.

- Use the Lavaan package in R to run the mediation model and calculate the bootstrapped indirect effect. 

- Create a path model diagram using your preferred software.

- Write-up a reproducible report using APA style and provide a discussion of the findings. If there are any differences between your analysis and theirs, describe them. Additionally, share your thoughts on how the authors shared their data.
