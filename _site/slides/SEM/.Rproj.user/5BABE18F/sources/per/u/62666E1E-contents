## Model Comparisons

- Nested models
- If you can create one model from another by the addition or subtraction of parameters, then it is nested
- Model A is said to be nested within Model B, if Model B is a more complicated version of Model A
- For example, a one-factor model is nested within a two-factor as a one-factor model can be viewed as a two-factor model in which the correlation between factors is perfect 

## Model Comparisons Nested Models

- Chi-square difference test - is this difference in models significant?
  - If yes, you say the model with the lower chi-square is better
- If no, you say they are the same and go with the simpler model

```{r}
chi_difference <- 12.6 - 4.3
df_difference <- 14 - 12
pchisq(chi_difference, df_difference, lower.tail = F)
```
