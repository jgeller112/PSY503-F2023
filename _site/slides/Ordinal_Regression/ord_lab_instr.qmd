I am a huge fan of Great British Bake-off. The dataset is taken from https://bakeoff.netlify.app/. You will be using will look at if `sex` and `age` of baker predicts how well they do in technical. For this exercise, we will only be looking at top 3 in technical.

-   Convert the outcome variable to an ordered factor.

    ```{r}

    ```

-   Convert input variables to categorical factors as appropriate.

    ```{r}

    ```

-   Make sure there are only 3 ranks being judged.

    ```{r}

    ```

-   Run a ordinal logistic regression model against all relevant input variables. Test main effects and interactions (even if they are non-significant).

-   Include a figure showing the interaction between Gender and Age.

-   Construct new outcome variables and use a stratified binomial approach to determine if the proportional odds assumption holds for your simplified model. Are there any input variables for which you may be concerned that the assumption is violated? What would you consider doing in this case?

-   Use the Brant test to support or reject the hypothesis that the proportional odds assumption holds for your simplified model.

-   Write a full report on your model

```{r}
#gbbo=read_csv(file.choose())

gb <- gbbo %>%
  filter(`Technical Rank` <=3) %>%
  mutate(Rank = as.factor(`Technical Rank`))

```

-   Fit a model that tests this:

    ```{r}

    model <- clm(Rank ~ Age*Gender, data=gb)

    summary(model)

    ```

-   Follow-up any significant effects (use \$\alpha\$ = .1)

    -   Have a look here to show you : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/sophisticated.html#ordinal.

        ```{r}

        ggemmeans(model, terms= c("Gender", "Age")) %>%
          plot()


        ```

-   Include a figure of the interaction between Gender and Age

-   Report findings

1.  Make up a hypothetical research question that is relevant to your specific program of research and that could be tested with ordinal regression
