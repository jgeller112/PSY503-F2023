# Hypotheses

## Predictions

Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables.

- Construct a model to determine how the data provided may help explain performance_group (Bottom performer, Middle performer, Top performer) of a manager. 

You will test whether a number of predictors can explain the performance group of a manager.  

# Methods

## Design

- All variables you could choose from: 

`employee_id` for each manager
`performance_group`(DV) of each manager in a recent performance review: Bottom performer, Middle performer, Top performer
`yrs_employed`: total length of time employed in years
`manager_hire`: whether or not the individual was hired directly to be a manager (Y) or promoted to manager (N)
`test_score`: score on a test given to all managers
`group_size`: the number of employees in the group they are responsible for
`concern_flag`: whether or not the individual has been the subject of a complaint by a member of their group
`mobile_flag`: whether or not the individual works mobile (Y) or in the office (N)
customers: the number of customer accounts the manager is responsible for
`high_hours_flag`: whether or not the manager has entered unusually high hours into their timesheet in the past year
`transfers`: the number of transfer requests coming from the manager’s group while they have been a manager
`reduced_schedule`: whether the manager works part time (Y) or full time (N)
`city`: the current office of the manager.

# Analysis plan

## Confirmatory analyses 

Describe the analyses that will test the predictions from the hypotheses section A. Include: 
    a) the relevant variables and how they are calculated
    na
    b) the statistical technique
    
    - Ordinal regression 
    
    c) Each variable’s role in the technique (e.g., IV, DV, moderator, mediator, covariate)
    nq
    d) rationale for each covariate used, if any.
    
     - You are creating you own ordinal model that will look at how different factors influence performance group


## Details of analysis

- Specify contingencies and assumptions, such as: 

    - Method of correction for multiple tests
    - The method of missing data handling (e.g., pairwise or listwise deletion, imputation, interpolation)
    
      - Pairwise deletion will be usedfor analysis variables. Observations with one or more missing observations for any variable used in either model will be excluded from all analyses.
      
    c) Reliability criteria for item inclusion in scale
    na
    d) Anticipated data transformations
    na
    e) Assumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated
    Assumptions underlying will be tested and corrected, if need be. 
    
    f) If applicable, you can refer to any files here that are related to your analyses (e.g., syntaxes, scripts, etc.).
