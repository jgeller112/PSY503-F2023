During the first day of class, I will provide a spreadsheet where you will select the week you want to be responsible for. Complete instructions and details for this assignment are here.\nLabs: Each week (Wednesday) we will have one corresponding lab exercise that will be started in class. The purpose is for you to get direct experience conducting the analyses that you learn. Each lab exercise will consist of several questions and will require R (will also accept Python) to answer the questions in a reproducible manner. All lab assignments must be reproducible (i.e., I can replicate the work you did without any errors). You may complete the labs by yourself or working with another person. If you work with another person, your work must obviously be your own.\n\nIdeally, you will finish labs in class. However, if you do not complete it in class, you can turn them in on Friday (due at 11:00 P.M.) Please let me know if you need an extension.\n\nTutorial: For your final project, you will create a tutorial explaining how to run a particular analysis in R. This will involve finding data or using your own data. The final project gives you a chance to pursue a specific method discussed in class and apply it to your own data.Complete instructions and details for this assignment are here."

R is free (!!), and highly sought after by employers, but it has a little bit of an initial learning curve. You’ll get the hang of it, though, I promise! I’m a certified RStudio instructor (see https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/), so I’ve been specially trained to teach statistical programming. Again, I promise that you’ll learn a ton.\nYou’ll be doing your stats work in RStudio this semester. While R and RStudio are free and open source, they can sometimes be tricky to install. To make life simpler, you can run RStudio in your browser without having to install anything (!!!). Over the course of the semester you’ll want to eventually install everything on your actual computer, since it’ll run faster there, but you won’t need to install anything to get started. I’ll e-mail you a link to join the class workspace.\nIn the meantime, you can also install everything on your actual computer if you follow these instructions (eventually you should do this—it’s best to run R on your own computer, but it’s totally fine to run everything at RStudio Cloud for the first few weeks)\nIf you have some free time over the next week and you feel like getting a head start, I would highly recommend going through a few of RStudio’s R Primers at https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers. Don’t worry if you don’t have time to go through these introductory primers/tutorials! Your first problem set is essentially doing those primers (see here for the ones you’ll need to do), so you don’t have to get a head start now if you don’t want to.\nOnce again, I promise that you can do this and have a blast in this class!"

    "text": "← News\n\n\n\nHello everyone!\nI’m Andrew Heiss, your professor for PMAP 8521 (Evaluation Research) this fall, and I’m so excited for the class! In this class you’ll learn all about causal inference, or how to legally claim causation with statistics. In your past stats courses you were always taught “correlation isn’t causation,” which is mostly true, except when it’s not. In this class you’ll get to legitimately make causal claims.\nWe’ll cover fun tools like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), randomized controlled trials, difference-in-differences analysis, regression discontinuity analysis, and instrumental variables. You’ll also learn the statistical language R, which is free (which means you can keep using it after you graduate and not have to pay for really really expensive SPSS or Stata licenses). I’ve had former students get jobs because of the R part of this class—tons of organizations are looking for R skills nowadays.\nI have a few important announcements before class:\n\nWe are meeting in person, but as you’ll see in the syllabus (see the “Masking and vaccines” section there, I’m trying to take as many precautions as possible given the rapid spread of the BA.5 variant. For instance…\n…I’ve made the course a flipped course, which means you’ll do all the readings and watch the lectures on YouTube before class on Mondays. We’ll spend our class time answering questions, doing activities, and learning a lot of R together. This means that the bulk of the course material is fully online and asynchronous.\nBefore class, I’d love to get to know each you a little first, so I’ve created a quick survey to fill out. I’ve sent you a link to it via e-mail. Please take it at your earliest convenience.\nThe entire course is available at a special class website at https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/. Bookmark this site—it’ll be your best friend for the next semester. I only use iCollege for collecting your assignments, posting answer keys, posting a couple scanned book chapters, and offering the two exams (since it’s password protected). This website is the official source of dates and all other class information. Because it’s not part of iCollege, you’ll be able to reference it even after you graduate and lose access to GSU resources. You can even share it with others—it’s just a website!\nPlease read the main explanatory pages at the course website at your earliest convenience. The instructions and expectations for the class are divided across different pages, all accessible from the menu bar at the top of the site. Please read the main pages for the syllabus, schedule, content, assignments, and examples.\nWe’re using zero physical textbooks in this class. Every reading and book and piece of software in this class is 100% free (see the syllabus for more information about that).\n\nQuick background about me: I’m an assistant professor here at the Andrew Young School, where I’ve been teaching MPA/MPP microeconomics, program evaluation, and data visualization. I moved here from Utah in 2019, where I was a visiting professor of public management at the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University (BYU). While at BYU, I taught microeconomics, statistics, and data visualization (basically the same stuff I’m teaching now). I finished my PhD in public policy and political science from Duke in 2017, and before then I finished my MPA in nonprofit management from BYU in 2012.\nWhen I’m not teaching stats and evaluation, I research international nonprofits and political science. And when I’m not teaching or researching, I’m normally chilling at my house with my 6 (!!) kids (see https://www.heissatopia.com/ for photos and hilarious stories).\nAgain, I’m really excited to get started next week. This fall semester should be a blast!"

This means that even after you finish the class and lose access to iCollege, and even after you graduate from GSU and lose access to your @gsu.edu e-mail address, you’ll still have a searchable archive of messages and FAQs from this class.\nI’ll let you know when there’s a new item in the news section in a few different ways:\n\nI’ll e-mail you a link to the newest message.

There’s a link at the bottom of the news page.\n\nPhew. That should be it from me for a while. Remember to read the syllabus and the rest of the course website, answer the welcome survey, sign up for Slack, and join the RStudio.cloud workspace. Also, remember to take care of yourselves!

Exciting!\nBeyond hoping that everyone is wearing a mask, I’ve structured the class in way that limits our exposure to each other as much as possible. As noted in the syllabus (https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus.html#course-structure), we’re using a flipped classroom this semester. What this means in practice is that you’ll do all the readings and watch asynchronous lecture videos before class meets on Mondays.\nOur in-person time will not involve lectures. Instead, it’ll be a more hands-on lab for working with R and answering the questions that come up from doing the readings and watching the lectures. That’s the point of the weekly check-in assignment (https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/assignment/weekly-check-in.html)—the only way this in-person time will be effective is if you do the readings + videos and ask questions in the weekly check-in.\nThe videos for the first day of class are live and ready to watch at https://evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/content/01-content.html (along with the readings). If possible, please watch them (and do the readings) before class on Monday so that we can start with the lab-like in-person time and get a good solid introduction to R and RStudio + answer the questions you have from the first session’s materials.\nIdeally, please try to submit the first weekly check-in on iCollege by tomorrow too so that we can have some good Q&A time during our in-person time. BUT no worries if not!\nIf you don’t have time to get through the materials before the first day, that’s totally fine—you can do it later and there’s no late penalty or anything for the first week, given that it is the first day of classes.

    "section": "",
    "text": "← News\n\n\n\nHi everyone!\nYou absolutely can (and should) reach out when you get stuck. I’m super responsive on Slack and e-mail. If you ask a question on the #help channel in Slack, others can help too. No question is too tricky or embarrassing, I promise. Computers are extraordinarily literal and tiny typos will often mess you up for a long time—I’ve lost countless time because of missing commas and misspelled words (curse you lenght()). Please feel comfortable reaching out.\n\nAsk early and often\nI’m a big believer in the 30 minute rule. If you’re stuck and not making progress on a task for 30 minutes, reach out for help from the community.\n\n\nBe nice\nOne of the great parts about the online R community is that the team at RStudio has actually hired people to help promote community norms. Like that’s their whole job—community evangelist (see @dataandme and @RachaelDempsey for instance). The R world is probably one of the nicest corners of the programming internet because of these norms—there’s an emphasis on helping beginners, being kind and respectful, and cheerfully helping as much as possible. Watch the #rstats hashtag on Twitter, look at the “r” tag on StackOverflow, and look at discussions at the RStudio Community and you’ll see kindness in action.\nThis was not always the case. 10ish years ago, before the RStudio people made a concerted effort to create community, the online R world was pretty mean and toxic, with forums run by a few really grumpy statisticians who’d belittle you if you asked a poorly worded question. It was awful. That kind of attitude often still persists in other languages (hooo boy try asking a beginner question about Python at StackOverflow 😬), but the R world has tried really hard to be welcoming.\nI embrace that attitude when teaching R, and I encourage you all to do the same. Reach out for help early and often. Do not suffer in silence. Do not spend hours and hours stuck on an issue before reaching out for help. If you feel comfortable, reach out publicly on the #help channel rather than a Slack DM so that others can help. This helps build and strengthen the community within our class and within the R community more broadly.\n\n\nAsk in a way that helps the answerer\nThere are a few easy guidelines to remember when asking for help:\n\nBe kind.\nTry asking questions with as complete information as possible. Rather than saying something like “my code isn’t working” and that’s it, provide more background (it’s hard to read your computer’s mind). Say specifically what you’re trying to do and provide code when possible. You can actually format R code on Slack if you click on the little lightning icon in the bottom left of the typing area and search for “text snippet”—that’ll open a dialog that will let you paste in text and add R syntax highlighting. You can also paste your code between triple backticks on Slack and it’ll format it in monospaced font (though not with the neat syntax highlighting that you get when using Slack’s text snippet thing):\n```\nggplot(blah) + geom_point()\n```\nYou can also take screenshots (use ⌘+shift+4 on macOS to save a screenshot to your Desktop, or ⌘+⌥+shift+4 to save a screenshot directly to the clipboard; use Windows+shift+S on Windows to save a screenshot directly to the clipboard). I’ve had people send photos from their phones too. The one issue with screenshots/photos is that it’s harder for people to get the code out of Slack and into RStudio on their computer to troubleshoot, since you can’t copy/paste from an image.\nTry making your question a reproducible example (or reprex). Reprexes are the best way to (1) get help online and (2) fix issues on your own.\nMaking a good reprex is tricky, but it’s a very valuable skill to know (regardless of programming language!). Here are some helpful resources for making them:\n\n What’s a reproducible example (reprex) and how do I do one?\n So you’ve been asked to make a reprex\n The reprex package\n\n\n\n\nDon’t suffer in silence\nAnd that’s it. Ask questions in ways that will help answerers answer them and be nice about it. When answering questions, be nice about it. Ask lots of questions. Answer lots of questions.\nOnce again, do not suffer in silence. I’ve had past students tell me that’s like the one thing they’ll remember from my classes—do not suffer in silence. I mean it, and I’ll keep saying it throughout the semester (because often in your past courses and degrees, you’ve been discouraged from reaching out or from building communities or whatever—that is not the case here)."

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to statistics with an emphasis on modeling. We cover many of the most widely applied data analysis models in psychology. We focus on data visualization, effect size estimation and interpretation, and using statistical analysis to inform scientific research questions. We develop practical skills related to data management, reproducibility, and statistical programming through the use of R, R Markdown/Quarto, and Github.\nI place a strong emphasis on practical application. I believe you are more likely to learn and readily use these analyses in the future if you do them at least once now. Every Wednesday there will be a lab going over the material covered that week. The lab assignments will help you build a personal library of example statistical scripts that you will hopefully find useful for years into the future. These lab assignments will be due at the end of the week."

This could include your own research or examples from the literature. If you wanted to walk through an example, that is also welcome.

You will write an .qmd file, that explains the issue, and gives example code showing how to solve the issue, or approach the issue. The process of writing a tutorial is a great way to learn the issues at hand yourself.\nAll of the tutorials will then be compiled together in a web-book.\nI expect the tutorial to be comprehensive enough to demonstrate that you have delved into the topic.

    "text": "This graduate-level course covers foundations of statistics in psychological research. It is required of all first-year students in the psychology Ph.D. program. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to statistics with an emphasis on modeling. We cover many of the most widely applied data analysis models in psychology. We focus on data visualization, effect size estimation and interpretation, and using statistical analysis to inform scientific research questions. We develop practical skills related to data management, reproducibility, and statistical programming through the use of R, R Markdown/Quarto, and Github.\nI place a strong emphasis on practical application. I believe you are more likely to learn and readily use these analyses in the future if you do them at least once now. Every Wednesday there will be a lab going over the material covered that week. The lab assignments will help you build a personal library of example statistical scripts that you will hopefully find useful for years into the future. These lab assignments will be due at the end of the week."

    "text": "Final Project\nYour semester project assignment is due at the end of the semester and is submitted as a link (to your project on Github or OSF) on Canvas.\nWe will discuss this project across the semester. As an overview, you will be demonstrating that you can conduct a reproducible analysis, which is an analysis of data that is independently verifiable. For example, someone else could obtain your data and code and independently reproduce your analysis.\nYou will complete three related parts.\n\nReproducible Report: Obtain open-data from an existing psych paper, load the data in R, and attempt to reproduce the statistical analysis that the original authors reported. If you have your own data you would like to analyze you can use this to\nAPA paper: Learn how to use the papaja package that allows you to compile .Rmd files to APA style manuscripts in pdf form. Then, write a short APA-style research report that describes your reproducible analysis.\nSimulation based power analysis: Include a simulation based power analysis at the end of your APA paper.\n\n\nPart 1: Reproducible report (10 points)\n\nFinding a paper with data\nHere are a few tips for finding a psych paper with open data. Most important, for this assignment you do not need to re-analyze all of the data from a particular paper. Many papers have multiple experiments, and multiple analyses, including analyses you may not be familiar with. You can restrict your re-analysis to a portion of the paper. For example, you might only re-analyze the results from one experiment, and perhaps only the results relevant to one of the tests reported for the experiment. You can limit your re-analyses to tests that have been covered in lecture or lab.\n\nhttps://osf.io The open science framework contains many repositories of open data that are part of published papers.\nSome journals, including Psychological Science, put badges on papers with open data. Look for the blue open-data badge. You will usually find the link to the open-data in the paper.\n\n\n\nLoading the data into R\nThe data you find could be in many different formats. It should be possible to load it into R and transform the data into the format/organization that you need to complete the analysis.\n\n\nRe-analysis of original data\nFocus on a single analysis that was relevant to one of the research questions. For example, if the analysis involved several t-tests:\n\nConduct and report the same t-tests\nReport a table of means\nReport a graph of the means\n\nfeel free to propose additional analyses\n\n\nWrite a reproducible report\nThe concept of a reproducible report is that someone else could exactly reproduce your analysis given your report. It is easy to make reproducible reports using R markdown. If you write your report in an .Rmd file, and that file includes your scripts for loading and analyzing the data, then by sharing your .rmd file, other people can exactly reproduce your report.\nYour report should include the following:\n\nA brief description of the research question and experiment (with citation to the paper, and link to find the data)\nThe R code chunks necessary to complete the re-analysis\nA write-up of your re-analysis results.\nA brief discussion of whether you were successful or not.\n\nIf you would like to run an additional analysis (not included in paper), also include a write-up of this.\n\n\n\nPart 2: APA paper in R markdown (10 points)\n\nPapaja\nIn part 2, you will learn how to use the papaja package to create APA style manuscripts using R markdown. We will discuss how to use papaja in class. You will create a new RMD file using the papaja template, and then transfer your reproducible report into this format. You will write very brief sections for:\n\nAbstract (50-100 words) (1 point)\nIntroduction (1 or two paragraphs) (1 point)\nMethods (1 paragraph) (1 point)\nResults (Your re-analysis results) (3 point)\n\n\nMust include the R code chunks for the analysis\nFull points only if the reporting of results is also reproducible (not by hand), as in the the example (see below).\n\n\nDiscussion (very brief, 1 paragraph) (1 point)\nReferences (cite the paper, and anything else you want to cite) (1 point)\nA completed RMD file and successfully compiled .pdf using papaja (2 points)\n\nAgain, the purpose here is not to write a full-length APA paper, but to get some experience with using the papaja package.\n\n\n\nPart 3: Power analysis (10 points)\n\nSimulation based power analysis\nIn part 3 you will add a simulation-based power analysis to your APA-style manuscript. While it is never advisable to calculate post-hoc power, think about this is as a future replication attempt. That is, given the current parameters (e.g., \\(\\mu M\\), \\(\\sigma \\Sigma\\)), if you were to replicate this study how many Ps would you need to achieve a certain level of power. Specifically, you should report a graph showing a power-curve for the design. We will discuss how to conduct simulation based power analyses in class.\nThe following should be included in the general discussion of your APA-paper (from part 2).\n\nThe R code chunk conducting your power analysis\nA paragraph or two discussing and explaining your power analysis to the reader, as well as reporting the results of the power analysis.\nA graph depicting a power-curve for the design.\nA statement about how the design might be changed to achieve a desired or preferred amount of power."
