Statistics is our way of detecting patterns in the noisy universe. Traditionally, psychologists were limited to research questions that could be answered with classical statistical analyses, but without particularly intending to do so, psychologists have found themselves at the cutting age of statistical discovery in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is because we needed to adapt our tools to meet the demands of the complex nature of the phenomena we study. This course will give you the quantitative tools to ask and answer research questions that were impossible to test as recently as a decade ago. Specifically, we will cover the following topics as stand-alone modules:\n\n1.  Missing Data\n2.  Robust Methods and Nonparamteric Statistics\n3.  Process models: Mediation, multiple mediation, mediated moderation, moderated mediation, path analysis\n4.  Non-Gaussian statistics: Generalized Linear Model, Poisson regression, ordinal regression, multinomial regression, bootstrapping\n5.  Beyond Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST): Structural equation models, Bayesian hypothesis testing\n6.  Dimension reduction: Exploratory factor analysis, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)\n7.  Time-based analyses: growth curve modeling\n8.  Meta-analysis\n\nI place a strong emphasis on practical application. I believe you are more likely to learn and readily use these analyses in the future if you do them at least once now. Every lecture will have \"challenge\" demonstrations for you to try the analyses along with me. Every Wednesday there will be a lab going over the material covered that week. The lab assignments will help you build a personal library of example statistical scripts that you will hopefully find useful for years into the future. These lab assignments will be due at the end of class.\n\n# Audience\n\nThis course is designed for quantitative psychologists but it is relevant to any social and natural scientists studying human behavior.\n\n\\vspace{.75cm}\n\n# Prerequisite\n\nThe main prerequisite for this course is PSY 503.\n\n**NOTE:** Students are expected to enroll in *PSY 505: Advances in Statistical Methods and Research Practices in Psychology* (Spring 2023, T: 11am - 1pm), which constitutes an important complement to this course. You can think of PSY 505 as the required precept time of the week for PSY 503. Please reach out to me if you would like to enroll in PSY 503 but are not able to take PSY 505.\n\n# Student Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\n1.  Make decisions regarding the most appropriate methods to use in addressing conceptual issues using a given data sets.\n2.  Conduct the analyses using R.\n3.  Write a summary of the results of the analyses.\n\n# Office Hourse\n\nI will hold weekly office hours (M: 1-3 P.M.; W: 1-2 P.M.)If you need to see me outside of these hours please schedule a meeting: https://calendly.com/jg9120/30min\n\n# Textbooks\n\n-   I strongly reccomend the following books:\n\n    -   McCoach, D. B., & Cintron, D. (2022). Introduction to Modern Modelling Methods (1st edition). SAGE Publications Ltd.\n\n        ![](modelingbook.jpg)\n\n-   Pett, M. A., Lackey, N. R., & Sullivan, J. (2003). Making Sense of Factor Analysis: The Use of Factor Analysis for Instrument Development in Health Care Research (1st edition). SAGE Publications, Inc.\n\n    ![](factor.jpg)\n\n-   Kabacoff, R. I. (2022). R in Action, Third Edition: Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse (3rd edition). Manning.\n\n    ![](rinaction.jpeg)\n\nI will select chapter(s) each week.\n\n# Attendance Policy\n\nAttendance and active participation in each class is required. 10% of your grade will be based on attendance and participation.\n\n# Absences and Late Work\n\nIf you need to be absent or submit an assignment late, please let me and Alex know as soon as possible. We don't need to know your personal or medical details. We can be flexible, but please respect my and Alex's time by turning your assignments in on time whenever possible.\n\n# Technology\n\nIt is expected that you will bring your laptop to class. Please try to keep it class related.\n\n\\vspace{.75cm}\n\n# Assignments\n\n## In-Class Labs (60%)\n\n- Each week (Wednesday) we will have one corresponding lab exercise that will be started in class. The purpose is for you to get direct experience conducting the analyses that you learn. Labs will be posted no later than 24 hours before the start of the last lecture of that module. Each lab exercise will have you conduct the analysis in a reproducible manner (i.e., saving your statistical syntax), create a figure, and write a concise (1 - 3 paragraphs) results section to describe your findings. You can complete the labs in either R or Python. You may complete the labs by yourself or working with another person. If you work with another person, your work must obviously be your own.\n\nCompleted labs will be due at 6:00 p.m. on the Friday of that week. All labs will be graded on a checkmark system of: (a) no check, (b) check, and (c) check plus. I expect the quality of most labs to be the equivalent of a check plus, so that should be the default mark. Late labs will get docked one point, such that the most you could earn on a late lab would be a \"check.\" However, please let me know if you need an extension.\n\n## Website and Tutorial (30%)\n\nFor your final project, you will build a website for yourself in R and as your first post create a tutorial explaining how to run a particular analysis in R. This will involve finding data or using your own data. The final project gives you a chance to create a professional website for yourself, but also pursue any topic in the R universe and learn more about it. For example, you could choose to write a tutorial on any R package or how to perform a statistical analysis.\n\nHere are some helpful links: \n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/\n\nhttps://crumplab.com/articles/blog/post_887_8_25_22_quartoblog/index.html\n\n**There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.**\n\n## Participation (10%)\n\nIt is important that you engage with the material. To this end, it is expected you will participate during class (i.e., come prepared each class session with questions and comments).\n\nEvery week you will submit 1-3 questions you had while reading or during lecture you did not get a chance to ask. \n\n# Grades\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| Points|Assignment           |Percent |\n|------:|:--------------------|:-------|\n|     60|Labs                 |60%     |\n|     30|Website and Tutorial |30%     |\n|     10|Participation        |10%     |\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Grade |Range   |\n|:-----|:-------|\n|A     |90–100% |\n|B     |80–89%  |\n|C     |70-79%  |\n|D     |60-69%  |\n:::\n:::\n\n# Diversity and Inclusion Statement\n\nI would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, SES, etc. )To help accomplish this:\n\n-   If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Princeton records, please let me know!\n\n-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class or in class, please bon't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).\n\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again,anonymous feedback is always an option).\n\n# Schedule\n\n**subject to change**\n\n\n\n",
