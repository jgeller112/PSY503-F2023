Go the the example page for this week, [\"Welcome to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse\"](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd), and work through the different primers and videos in the four parts of the page.\n\n    It seems like there's a lot on the page, but they're short and go fairly quickly (especially as you get the hang of the syntax). Also, **I have no way of seeing what you do or what you get wrong or right, and that's totally fine!** If you get stuck and want to skip some (or if it gets too easy), go right ahead and skip them!\n\n\n## Task 2: Make an RStudio Project\n\n1. Use either RStudio.cloud or RStudio on your computer (preferably RStudio on your computer! [Follow these instructions to get started!](/resource/install.qmd)) to create a new RStudio Project. Refer to the [example page you read in Task 1 for instructions](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd#part-3-rstudio-projects)\n\n2. Create a folder named \"data\" in the project folder you just made.\n\n3. Download this CSV file and place it in that folder:\n\n    - [{{< fa file-csv >}} `cars.csv`](/files/data/package_data/cars.csv)\n\n4. In RStudio, go to \"File\" > \"New Fileâ€¦\" > \"R Markdownâ€¦\" and click \"OK\" in the dialog without changing anything.\n\n5. Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it with this:\n\n\n    \n    ````default\n    ---\n    title: \"Problem set 1\"\n    author: \"Put your name here\"\n    output: html_document\n    ---\n    \n    ```{r load-libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n    library(tidyverse)\n    \n    cars <- read_csv(\"data/cars.csv\")\n    ```\n    \n    \n    # Learning R\n    \n    Tell me that you worked through the primers and videos and examples at the example page for this week:\n    \n    WRITE SOMETHING HERE LIKE \"I did all the primers and had the time of my life!\" or whatever.\n    \n    \n    # My first plots\n    \n    Insert a chunk below and use it to create a scatterplot (hint: `geom_point()`) with diplacement (`displ`) on the x-axis, city MPG (`cty`) on the y-axis, and with the points colored by drive (`drv`).\n    \n    PUT CHUNK HERE\n    \n    Insert a chunk below and use it to create a histogram (hint: `geom_histogram()`) with highway MPG (`hwy`) on the x-axis. Do not include anything on the y-axis (`geom_histogram()` will do that automatically for you). Choose an appropriate bin width. If you're brave, facet by drive (`drv`).\n    \n    PUT CHUNK HERE\n    \n    \n    # My first data manipulation\n    \n    Insert a chunk below and use it to calculate the average city MPG (`cty`) by class of car (`class`). This won't be a plot---it'll be a table. Hint: use a combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n    \n    PUT CHUNK HERE\n    ````\n\n6. Save the R Markdown file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**)\n\n7. Your project folder should look something like this:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../files/img/assignments/project-structure.png){fig-align='center' width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Task 3: Work with R\n\n1. Remove the text that says \"PUT CHUNK HERE\" and insert a new R code chunk. Either type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS, or use the \"Insert Chunk\" menu:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../files/img/assignments/insert-chunk-button.png){fig-align='center' width=19%}\n:::\n:::\n\n2. Follow the instructions for the three chunks of code.\n\n3. Knit your document as a Word file (or PDF if you're brave and [installed LaTeX](/resource/install.qmd#install-tinytex)). Use the \"Knit\" menu:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../files/img/assignments/knit-button.png){fig-align='center' width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n4. Upload the knitted document to iCollege.\n\n5. ðŸŽ‰ Party! ðŸŽ‰\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\nYou'll be doing this same process for all your future problem sets. Each problem set will involve an R Markdown file. You can either create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../files/img/reference/rproj-one-folder.png){fig-align='center' width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\nOr you can create individual projects for each assignment and project:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../files/img/reference/rproj-multiple-folders.png){fig-align='center' width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n",
